mosaics just okay 
data000 RGB-10-2-0.48-11111
data001 BW-2-6-0.48-11111
data002 NSEM GLM fit
* rasters looked fine for NSEM
data003 WN GLM fit
* Cells appear to be a bit less active? piece may be starting to die. rasters didn?t look good
data004 Null stimulus,check 18.rawMovie and matlab code.

very good mosaics except for OFF midgets
got through 5 NSEM movies + lava 
the best NSEM piece of 2014 for sure

Beautiful mosaics! long runs 
data000 RGB-8-1-0.48-11111 1800 seconds
data001 BW and NSEM GLM Run 5665 seconds NSBrownian_3000_A_025, variable BW seed starting at 11111, BW-4-1-0.24 (mean 0.25)
BW runs are lower, less variable firing. firing rate looks as expected except for 3rd BW run. also potentially cut off the last NSEM run- it was very close.
data002 BW and NSEM GLM Run 5670 seconds, NSBrownian_3000_B_025, variable BW seed starting at 22222
data003 BW and NSEM GLM Run NSBrownian_3000_C_025 and variable BW seed starting at 33333
data004 RGB-8-1-0.48-11111 30 minutes

great on and off parasols, good on midgets, longish 
data000 RGB-8-1-0.24-11111 mean 0.25 classification run lab view error at 1345 seconds, but piece seemed very stable
data001 RGB-8-1-0.48-11111 mean 0.25 classification run 
data002 NSEM and BW GLM fits: incredibly stable (11 PM)
data003 paused to restart trap
data 004 NSEM and BW GLM fits 2: started to fade a bit by the end (1 AM)
data005 RGB-8-1-0.24-11111 mean 0.25 (2:50AM)
lost a lot of cells. taking down.

great on and off parasol, good off midget, only half off midgets and a TON of amacrines!
Finer WN (4 stix) 
data001 RGB-8-1-0.24-11111 mean 0.25 1800s
data002 WN and NSEM model fitting run. 6700s
WN at both 4 stixel and 8 stixel for comparison. The piece responded well to 4-1 and 8-1 BW.  Made it through first 3 repeats, then stopped to empty trap
data003 WN and NSEM model fitting run. 6700s 8 PM
WN at both 4 stixel and 8 stixel for comparison.
spike rate has noticeably decreased, so stopping after 2 blocks and running bookend
data004 RGB-8-1-0.24-11111 mean 0.25 400s cutoff because of streaming error and restarted
data005 RGB-8-1-0.24-11111 mean 0.25 1800s many cells lost, taking piece down.

pretty good mosaics, a few holes
lots of large, blue, amacrine
