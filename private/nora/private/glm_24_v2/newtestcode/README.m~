GLM is meant to be run out of this folder.

Trying to have a fully modular directory tracking.
Will first work to link code to glm_fit_AH_21

Then work on fully clean code that doesn't rely on the rk2 mess


Consider
1) see how Basepars is called by llfunc2AH to so we can link to it
2) try linking to glm_AH_spaceonly
3) keep all of the loading in glm_wrap      easiest that way
