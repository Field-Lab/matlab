Instructions for repeating Malcolmâ€™s analysis

Datasets:
2007-03-27-1, runs 12-19 (I used runs 14-19)
2007-08-24-4, runs 2-11 (I used runs 4-11)
2005-04-26-0 looked promising, but needs to be cleaned up

Scripts:
make_figures_malcolm.m
	Can reproduce all of the plots I made.
motion_script_malcolm.m
	Can reproduce all of the analyses I did, including downsampling. 
	Based on motion_script.m by Marvin Thielke.

Necessary helper scripts:
auto_set_params.m
motion_signal.m
nearest_neighbor_distances.m
pop_motion_signal.m
