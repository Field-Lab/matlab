HOW TO INSTALL PROPERLY
=======================
1. In addition to downloading this code, you also need to download the code from the "FAST ICA" package (for the "icademo" code to work properly). This FREE package is officially available at:
   http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/ica/fastica/
Please get your copy of FASTICA at this website. It is free and only requires a simple registration. Off the record, for those somewhat lazy, I have a copy also available at:
   http://www.snl.salk.edu/~shlens/pub/code/fastica.zip

2. Make sure that all of the directories including the demos and the FASTICA package are in your Matlab path. If you don't know what this means, just ask someone, email me or type "help path" in Matlab.

3. I can't guarantee that all of the graphical user interfaces (GUI's) in Matlab will look correct. The variability in font sizes and lack of standardization between Matlab versions might make the GUI look funny. But I assure you that it should be fully functional.

4. Within most subdirectories, I have included a TUTORIAL.txt file. This text file provides a step by step lesson for the demo to hopefully provide some insight into the algorithm.

5. If you have any questions about the .M files or the demos themselves, check out the help files associated with the functions.

6. The ICADEMO constains two algorithms for performing ICA: "infomax" and "fastica." One can now compare the performance of the two ICA algorithms on super and sub-gaussian distributions (see part 6 of TUTORIAL.txt).

enjoy.
