function polylines2d(varargin)
%POLYLINES2D  description of functions operating on polylines
%   
%   Polylines are represented by a set of points. Contrary to polygons,
%   polylines are open: the last point is not connected to the first one.
%   
%   As most functions were used to describe curved objects, the name
%   'curve' is often present in function names.

%   subCurve, curveLength, curveCentroid, parametrize, curvature
