glm_postfilterNL_LNonly
(focus on parametrically searching the non-linearity using likelihood)
Version 1a:
- 2015-06-15
- Plotting DONE.. ready to roll
- Good enough to steam forward with analysis of effect of modulating NL

Version 1:
- 2015-06-15
- redone interpreation of Non-linearity
- ready to plot and clean up

Version 0_a:
- 2015-06-15
- extra save, just to be conservative

Version 0:
- 2015-06-11
- no need to optimize offset MU .. keep as is
- no need to play with VU term of Generalized Logistic
- standard 2 par logistic looks like enough 
- fix lcif.stim (0) = 1.   no gain while null space
- still need to plot


glm_postfilterNL_wrap: 
this should largely not be used anymore!! comment 2015-06-15



Version 13: 2015-06-11
focus first on building code in Develop folder
directories smoothed out

Version 12 was done before 2015-06-11
Old code which rescaled the PS Filter.
