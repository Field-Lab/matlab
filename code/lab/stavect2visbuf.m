function buf = stavect2visbuf(stavect, width, height)
% Transform Matlab STA vector into Vision STA buffer format vector
% 
% Normal Matlab STA format is Y-X-C-T in separate dimensions.  Vision 
% buffer format is C-X-Y dimensions collapsed in that order in a single 
% vector for each time frame.
%
% A particular case where combining Matlab STA formatted data with Vision
% buffer formatted data is useful is if the Matlab data can be made sparse.
% Matlab sparse matrices cannot be >2D, so this generally involves making
% the Matlab STA into a vector of Y-X-C collapsed for each time frame.  
% E.g. the Wc matrix from cone finding or the STRF matrices used as input
% to generator signal calculations.
%
% STAVECT2VISBUF is a function to convert Matlab YXC sparse vectors to CXY
% Vision buffer vectors.
