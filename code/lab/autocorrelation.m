function [probabilities, bins, norm] = autocorrelation(spike_times, bin_size, duration, recording_length)
% autocorrelation     calculates the autocorrelation in a spike train given
%                       a bin size and duration
%
% usage:  [probabilities,bins] = autocorrelation(spike_times, bin_size, duration, recording_length)
%
% arguments:     spike_times - spike times (in seconds)
%            bin_size - size of bins (in seconds)
%            duration - duration overwhich to calculate the autocorrelation
%                       in seconds
%            recording_length = total length of stimulus
% outputs:     probabilities - normalized probability density across all
%                               spikes

% 2011-02 GDF
% 2014-01 sravi modified ACF to calculate distribution of times between any 2 spikes
%               made code more efficient by vector indice increment,summing, looking at spike times in the duration range
